# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Added
- **VNC** for every QEMU-backed VM via a unix socket — no port allocation.
- **Interactive console/shell** — `GET /v1/vms/{id}/console` (WebSocket) and the guest agent's `OpenShell` vsock op for a real PTY.
- **File transfer** — `PutFile`/`GetFile` guest-agent vsock ops (`POST /v1/vms/{id}/agent/{put,get}-file`).
- **virtiofs shared folders** (QEMU backend).
- **True suspend-to-disk resume** (`-loadvm`) and a virtio-scsi controller.
- **Static-IP netns mode** — the guest gets a real DHCP-leased IP, with deterministic address reservation.
- **`GET /v1/vms/{id}/cpuset`**.
- **Kubernetes DaemonSet packaging** (`fluxvm-kube`).
- Catalog: read-only flag and orphaned-download cleanup.
- Cross-distro CI job, build-image tutorials, and a real-hardware boot smoke test.
- Multiple hypervisor backends: `fluxvm-hypervisor`, `fluxvm-cloud-hypervisor`, `fluxvm-firecracker` (alongside the existing QEMU backend).

### Changed
- **Image customization now goes through GuestKit** instead of virt-customize/libguestfs.
- Renamed Ephemera to FluxVM; added an agent-sandbox track.
- `KillMode=process` on the systemd unit, so a daemon restart/upgrade no longer SIGTERMs every running VM's QEMU process.

### Fixed
- CPU/memory hotplug (no reserved PCIe root port slots) and NIC hotplug (missing `bridge.conf`) — hotplug now actually attaches.
- Usermode-network hostfwd bound to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`.
- Guest agent `OpenShell`: isolated into a double-forked process, never reaped its own shell child, fixed `EPERM` on `TIOCSCTTY`, added `PrivateTmp` for disk provisioning.
- Dockerfile build failure (stale Rust pin, missing `--locked`).
- `-nodefaults` was dropping the implicit VGA card — added explicit `-vga std`.
- `ephemera-image` (now the image crate) mounts guest fstab entries shallowest-first.
- systemd: grant `CAP_SYS_CHROOT` for GuestKit's image-customization chroot, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and a writable `/var/lock` for disk provisioning.
- systemd: `/sys/fs/cgroup/fluxvm.slice` creation failed with `Permission denied` despite running as root — the unit's capability set didn't include `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`, so root's usual DAC bypass against the cgroupfs's `dr-xr-xr-x` mode didn't apply. Found live: every VM start/restart since a host reboot left `VmRecord.cgroup_path` null, breaking memory limit/usage and any other cgroup-based resource control.
- systemd: `RuntimeDirectory=fluxvm`/`StateDirectory=fluxvm` replace a plain `ExecStartPre mkdir` for `/run/fluxvm` — the old approach raced ProtectSystem's namespace setup and failed with `226/NAMESPACE` on every fresh boot (`/run` is a tmpfs, wiped every reboot).
- cloud-init: `write_files` support in `CloudInitSpec`.
- Test fixtures: added `shared_folders`/`virtiofsd_pids` to the storage test fixture.
- Fixed the pacman branch of the GuestKit package install and hardened its regression test.
