**Disposable Compute Engine** — create secure, isolated, short-lived virtual machines using
Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor, and QEMU/KVM from one Rust-native control plane.

- **QEMU/KVM** — broad guest/device compatibility, qcow2 CoW overlays, QMP socket.
- **Cloud Hypervisor** — Rust VMM for modern cloud workloads, direct-kernel or firmware boot.
- **Firecracker** — microVM backend using a Linux kernel + raw root filesystem.

It also contains a small **virt-builder-style image pipeline**: use a local/HTTP base image, verify SHA-256, convert/resize it, and customize it before first boot.

Beyond a single host: a `DisposableVm` Kubernetes CRD + node-local operator (`ephemera-kube`), and a
non-Kubernetes distributed node-agent (`ephemera-agent`) with a central fleet registry and load-aware
placement across multiple hosts — see "Kubernetes CRD/operator" and "Distributed node-agent" below.

> This repository is a complete MVP/control-plane skeleton, not a finished multi-tenant security boundary. Authentication/RBAC, the Firecracker jailer (chroot + uid/gid isolation), cgroup v2 resource control, and per-VM network namespaces are already implemented (see "Auth / RBAC", "Firecracker jailer", "Resource control (cgroup v2)", and "Network namespaces" below) — before exposing it to untrusted tenants, still add seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux policy, quotas, audit logging and stronger image provenance.

See [`docs/use-cases.md`](docs/use-cases.md) for concrete use cases — ephemeral CI runners, a golden-image pipeline, Kubernetes-native disposable workloads, multi-host fleets without Kubernetes, and sandboxed code execution — each grounded in what's actually implemented below. **Ragnarok product path:** [`docs/ragnarok.md`](docs/ragnarok.md).

## Project layout

The MVP is a Cargo workspace, structured to match Zyvor Ephemera's longer-term
multi-node architecture:

```

`ephemera-agent` (a distinct concept from `ephemera-guest-agent` above — this one is the
per-*host* node-agent for multi-node deployments) and `ephemera-kube` are both implemented
and verified against real multi-host/cluster infrastructure — see "Distributed node-agent"
and "Kubernetes CRD/operator" below.

This project also depends on the sibling [`guestkit`](../guestkit) project (a
pure-Rust, qemu-nbd-based disk toolkit) as a path dependency from `ephemera-image`,
for injecting files into an offline image — see "Build an image" below.

**Suite split:** GuestKit **certifies and repairs** disks (doctor, passport, gate,
offline plans). Ephemera **runs and manages** the resulting qcow2s (overlay, TAP /
netns / DHCP, cloud-init, TTL, fleets). Do not re-implement Ephemera networking or
lifecycle inside GuestKit — hand off after passport verify.

## What is implemented

- Common `VmBackend` Rust trait: launch, pause, resume, graceful shutdown.
- QEMU backend, pause/resume/shutdown via QMP.
- Cloud Hypervisor backend, pause/resume/shutdown via `ch-remote`.
- Firecracker backend using JSON `--config-file`, pause/resume via `PATCH /vm`, shutdown via `SendCtrlAltDel`.
- Vsock guest agent (`ephemera exec <id> -- <command>`) — run a command inside the guest with no SSH and no network path at all; works over QEMU's native AF_VSOCK device and Cloud Hypervisor/Firecracker's UDS vsock proxy.
- `stop` prefers a graceful VMM shutdown, falling back to force-kill only if the process doesn't exit within a grace period.
- QEMU qcow2 backing overlays for cheap disposable writes.
- Raw reflink copies for Firecracker / Cloud Hypervisor when the host filesystem supports reflinks.
- Raw conversion fallback through `qemu-img`.
- Optional disk growth.
- Pluggable storage backends beyond the qcow2/raw defaults above: LVM thin snapshots, NBD-exported disks, and Ceph RBD — all three verified booting real guests (Ceph RBD against a real Rook Ceph cluster); see "Storage backends" below.
- cloud-init NoCloud seed disk generation.
- TAP interface creation and optional Linux bridge attachment.
- macvtap networking (QEMU and Cloud Hypervisor) — a VM's own MAC directly on a parent link, no bridge.
- QEMU user-mode networking + host port forwarding.
- VM state persisted to JSON.
- REST API.
- CLI.
- TTL reaper that destroys expired VMs.
- Console log path per VM.
- Control sockets: QMP, Cloud Hypervisor API socket, Firecracker API socket.
- Image download/cache + SHA-256 verification.
- Image build customization, all via `guestkit` (no libguestfs appliance): package install, hostname, arbitrary commands, SSH-key injection, `copy_in` for injecting files (e.g. the guest agent binary), and `enable_services` for enabling systemd units.
- systemd units and one-command host bootstrap (installs QEMU tooling, Cloud Hypervisor, and Firecracker).
- SSH/rsync remote deploy script with full and quick profiles.
- End-to-end networking smoke test (QEMU user-mode NAT, TAP+bridge+DHCP, and macvtap, all SSH-verified).
- End-to-end lifecycle smoke test (vsock exec, pause/resume, graceful shutdown, and vsock-CID uniqueness under concurrent creates, all verified against real VMs).
- Kubernetes `DisposableVm` CRD + node-local operator (`ephemera-kube`), verified against a real k3s cluster — see "Kubernetes CRD/operator" below.
- Distributed node-agent (`ephemera-agent`): central fleet registry + per-host heartbeat client with load-aware placement, verified across two real physically separate hosts — see "Distributed node-agent" below.

## Host requirements

Linux x86_64 with virtualization enabled and `/dev/kvm` available.

Typical packages/tools:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64
qemu-img
cloud-localds
ip
cp
```

Neither Cloud Hypervisor nor Firecracker is packaged by `apt`/`dnf`, so this repo ships installer
scripts that fetch the upstream release binary for your CPU architecture (x86_64 or aarch64) and
verify it against the SHA-256 digest GitHub records for that release asset before installing it.

For Firecracker, provide a compatible uncompressed guest kernel (`vmlinux`) and a Linux rootfs. For Cloud Hypervisor, use either direct kernel boot or firmware boot. The project's Rust Hypervisor Firmware (`hypervisor-fw`) is passed through the request's `kernel` field, matching the Cloud Hypervisor quick-start; `firmware` is reserved for firmware loaded through the VMM's `--firmware` option.

## Prepare host (one command)

On a fresh Linux box, this installs the system packages (`qemu-system-x86_64`, `qemu-img`,
`cloud-localds`), Cloud Hypervisor, Firecracker, and Rust Hypervisor Firmware, loads the `nbd`
kernel module (needed by `guestkit` for image customization), then creates the state directories
and an optional bridge:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/bootstrap-host.sh vmbr0
```

Skip pieces you don't want with `SKIP_CLOUD_HYPERVISOR=1`, `SKIP_FIRECRACKER=1`, or `SKIP_BRIDGE=1`.
If a VM needs outbound connectivity through a TAP bridge, configure bridge addressing/NAT/DHCP for
your environment yourself — the MVP intentionally does not mutate host firewall/NAT policy.

Run `./scripts/preflight.sh` afterward to confirm every tool is on `PATH`.

### Installing (or updating) a single VMM

```bash
./scripts/install-cloud-hypervisor.sh            # latest release, both cloud-hypervisor + hypervisor-fw
./scripts/install-cloud-hypervisor.sh v53.0       # pin a version
./scripts/install-cloud-hypervisor.sh --no-firmware

./scripts/install-firecracker.sh                  # latest release, firecracker + jailer
./scripts/install-firecracker.sh v1.16.1          # pin a version
```

Both scripts resolve the requested (or latest) GitHub release, download the arch-appropriate
binary, verify its SHA-256 digest, and `install` it to `/usr/local/bin` (override with
`INSTALL_DIR=...`). They are safe to re-run — an already-installed matching version is a no-op.

## Build

Use a current stable Rust toolchain. This is a Cargo workspace; `cargo build` builds every crate,
producing the `ephemera` CLI at `target/release/ephemera`:

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo install -m 0755 target/release/ephemera /usr/local/bin/ephemera
sudo install -m 0644 config.example.toml /etc/ephemera.toml
```

`cargo build --release` also produces `target/release/ephemera-kube` (the Kubernetes operator — see
"Kubernetes CRD/operator") and `target/release/ephemera-agent` (the fleet registry/node-agent — see
"Distributed node-agent"); neither is installed by the two commands above, since not every deployment
needs either.

## Deploy to a remote host

`scripts/deploy-remote.sh` does the above end-to-end over SSH: rsync the source, install system
packages + Cloud Hypervisor/Firecracker, install a Rust toolchain if needed, build, and install the
binary, config, and systemd unit.

```bash
./scripts/deploy-remote.sh 10.0.0.5 deploy --key   # full deploy, SSH key auth
./scripts/deploy-remote.sh deploy@10.0.0.5 --quick  # rsync + build only, skip dep install
./scripts/deploy-remote.sh 10.0.0.5 deploy --verify-only
./scripts/deploy-remote.sh --help
```

## Testing networking end-to-end

`scripts/test-networking.sh` boots real VMs over each supported network mode and proves they're
actually reachable over SSH — not just that the process launched:

- **QEMU user-mode NAT** + host port forward (no host network changes required).
- **TAP + Linux bridge + DHCP** (against an existing bridge with a DHCP server on it, e.g.
  libvirt's `virbr0` or a bridge set up by `bootstrap-host.sh`). Skipped with a warning if the
  bridge doesn't exist.
- **macvtap**, against a throwaway `dummy0` parent by default so the test never touches a real
  physical NIC/switch (pass `--macvtap-parent eth0` to test against a real uplink instead). Since
  macvtap's `bridge` mode can't reach the parent/host directly, the test creates a second, host-side
  macvtap sibling on the same parent to reach the guest's statically-assigned IP.

All three also assert cleanup: the QEMU process and (for TAP/macvtap) the interface must actually be
gone after `ephemera delete` — this is what caught a TAP-interface leak during development (fixed
by making VM shutdown wait for the process to actually exit before releasing its network resources).

```bash
sudo ./scripts/test-networking.sh                          # bridge defaults to vmbr0, macvtap uses dummy0
sudo ./scripts/test-networking.sh --bridge virbr0           # test TAP against libvirt's default network
sudo ./scripts/test-networking.sh --macvtap-parent eth0     # test macvtap against a real uplink
sudo ./scripts/test-networking.sh --image /path/to/base.qcow2   # skip auto-downloading a test image
```

It downloads an Ubuntu 24.04 cloud image on first run (cached under `<state_dir>/images/`) unless
`--image` is given, generates a throwaway SSH keypair, and prints a pass/fail/warn summary.

`scripts/test-lifecycle.sh` covers the rest of the VM lifecycle the same way: boots a QEMU VM with
the guest agent enabled and `network.mode=none`, proves `exec` round-trips real output over vsock
(no network path exists at all), forces a CPU-bound loop into the guest so pausing has something to
verify (an idle guest's VMM process shows ~flat CPU time whether it's paused or just idle — this
avoids that false signal), confirms the VMM's own CPU-time counter actually freezes while paused,
confirms `exec` works again after resume, confirms `stop` exits the VMM process, and confirms two
concurrently-created VMs get distinct vsock CIDs. QEMU only — Cloud Hypervisor and Firecracker were
validated manually (see "Pause, resume, and exec" below) since they need a Firecracker-compatible
uncompressed `vmlinux` / extracted whole-disk rootfs respectively, more setup than belongs in an
unattended script.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/test-lifecycle.sh
sudo ./scripts/test-lifecycle.sh --image /path/to/base.qcow2
```

## Network namespaces (real per-VM network isolation)

`"network": {"mode": "tap", "netns": true}` gives a VM its own network namespace instead of putting
its tap directly on a shared host bridge — a separate routing table, iptables, and interface list, not
just a shared L2 segment. `bridge` is ignored in this mode (there's no shared bridge to join). Built
from a veth pair NATed to the host, plus a small internal bridge inside the namespace joining the
veth's namespace end to the VM's own tap:

```text
  host default netns                    │  VM's own netns
  <vethh> 169.254.X.1/30 ──veth pair──►  <vethn> ── <br> ── <tap> ── guest
  iptables MASQUERADE                    │  default route via 169.254.X.1
```

The VMM process itself is launched inside the namespace (`ip netns exec`) — it has to be, to even see
the tap device, which lives in a different network namespace than the VMM would otherwise be in. This
composes with the Firecracker jailer (`ip netns exec <ns> -- jailer ... -- firecracker ...`): network
namespace and mount/chroot isolation are independent kernel mechanisms and stack cleanly.

```json
{"name": "isolated-vm", "backend": "qemu", "image": "...", "network": {"mode": "tap", "netns": true}}
```

Verified on real hardware (`scripts/test-network-namespace.sh`, 10/10): the namespace/veth/bridge/tap
really exist (read directly from `ip netns exec ... ip link show`); the VMM process is confirmed to
really be running inside that namespace by comparing `/proc/<pid>/ns/net` against the namespace's own
inode (the only way to actually prove two things share a network namespace); a real ping across the
veth pair from inside the namespace proves the NAT path genuinely works end to end, not just that the
interfaces exist; deleting the VM tears down the whole namespace with no leftover host-side veth
interfaces (deleting a netns cascades to every interface inside it, including — since a veth is one
kernel object with two ends — the host-side peer).

```bash
sudo ./scripts/test-network-namespace.sh --image /path/to/base.qcow2
```

## Create a QEMU disposable VM

Edit `examples/qemu.json` to point at your base image and SSH public key.

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml create \
  --spec examples/qemu.json
```

Example behavior:

- base image stays untouched;
- a qcow2 overlay is created for the instance;
- cloud-init seed disk is generated;
- TCP host port 2222 is forwarded to guest port 22;
- the VM automatically expires after 900 seconds.

## Create a Cloud Hypervisor VM

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml create \
  --spec examples/cloud-hypervisor.json
```

The backend uses a raw per-instance disk. If the base image is already raw and the filesystem supports reflinks, the clone is copy-on-write at the filesystem level.

## Create a Firecracker microVM

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml create \
  --spec examples/firecracker.json
```

Firecracker does not use BIOS/UEFI in this flow. The request supplies the Linux kernel and the manager supplies a raw block rootfs.

## Firecracker jailer (chroot, uid/gid isolation, cgroups)

Opt-in, off by default, config-only (no per-VM flag) — every Firecracker VM either goes through
`jailer` or none do:

```toml
[jailer]
enabled = true
jailer_binary = "jailer"          # resolved via $PATH unless you give an absolute path
uid = 123                         # must be non-root; unique per tenant for a real isolation boundary
gid = 100
chroot_base_dir = "/srv/jailer"   # should be on the same filesystem as state_dir (see below)
```

`firecracker_binary` must be an absolute path when jailer is enabled — `jailer`'s `--exec-file` needs
a real path, not a bare command resolved via `$PATH`.

Ephemera hardlinks the kernel and rootfs into `jailer`'s chroot (`<chroot_base_dir>/<firecracker
basename>/<vm-id>/root/`) before invoking it — falling back to a real copy if `chroot_base_dir` is on
a different filesystem than the source files, which is why same-filesystem placement matters (a
multi-GB rootfs copy per VM otherwise). Every subsequent control-plane operation (pause/resume/stop,
vsock exec) is routed through the VM's *actual* recorded socket paths rather than a path reconstructed
from its workspace directory — necessary because jailing relocates both the Firecracker API socket and
the vsock proxy socket into the chroot, a genuinely different location than the non-jailed case.

Verified on real hardware (`scripts/test-firecracker-jailer.sh`): the resulting Firecracker process
really runs as the configured unprivileged uid/gid (confirmed via `ps`, not just "the command didn't
error"); the guest boots and answers `exec` over vsock through the relocated proxy socket;
pause/resume/stop all work against the relocated API socket; `delete` cleans up both the normal
workspace and the separate jail chroot tree, leaving no orphaned files or process.

## Auto backend selection

Set `"backend": "auto"` and the manager picks a concrete backend for you, resolved once at the very
start of `create` (the resolved value — never `"auto"` — is what's persisted and returned):

1. **Firecracker** if the request has a `kernel`, or `firecracker_kernel` is set in the config — the
   fastest microVM start when a direct-boot kernel is available.
2. otherwise **Cloud Hypervisor** if the request has a `kernel`/`firmware`, or
   `cloud_hypervisor_firmware` is set in the config.
3. otherwise **QEMU** — the only one of the three that boots from just a disk image, via its own
   BIOS/UEFI, with no kernel or firmware required.

```json
{ "name": "auto-example", "backend": "auto", "image": "/var/lib/ephemera/images/ubuntu.qcow2", "...": "..." }
```

Verified on real hardware (`scripts/test-auto-backend.sh`): all three resolution paths actually boot
the chosen backend and answer over vsock, not just that `resolve_backend` returns the right enum
value in isolation.

## Policy (admission limits)

`[policy]` in the config file (see `config.example.toml`) lets an operator cap what a `create`
request is allowed to ask for. Every field is optional and defaults to unrestricted — an absent or
empty `[policy]` table behaves exactly like no policy at all:

```toml
[policy]
max_vcpus = 8
max_memory_mib = 16384
max_disk_gib = 100
max_ttl_seconds = 86400          # every request must set ttl_seconds <= this; unbounded VMs are rejected
allowed_backends = ["qemu", "firecracker"]
allowed_image_dirs = ["/var/lib/ephemera/images"]
```

Checked once, right after `"auto"` resolves to a concrete backend and before any disk/network work
starts, so a rejected request fails fast with a specific reason (`request vcpus (4) exceeds policy
max_vcpus (2)`, `policy requires ttl_seconds to be set...`, `backend Firecracker is not permitted by
policy allowed_backends [Qemu]`, etc.) rather than a generic 400. `allowed_image_dirs` is a plain
path-prefix check — good enough to stop a tenant pointing `image` at an arbitrary host path, not a
symlink-resistant sandboxing boundary. Verified against a real config on real hardware: all five
cases (four rejections, one compliant create that actually boots) behave as documented.

## Pause, resume, and exec

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml pause <id>
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml resume <id>
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml exec <id> -- echo hello
```

`exec` requires `agent.enabled: true` in the VM spec (see the JSON contract below) and the guest
image to have `ephemera-guest-agent` installed and running — build it with `cargo build --release
-p ephemera-guest-agent` and bake it into an image via `build-image`'s `copy_in`/`enable_services`
(see "Build an image" below, and `systemd/ephemera-guest-agent.service`).

**Guest-agent auth:** every agent-enabled VM gets a random shared-secret token (or the one you set in
`agent.token`) burned into that VM's own disk — never the shared base image — before it boots, at
`/etc/ephemera-guest-agent.token`. The agent checks it on every request; `eph exec`/the REST `/agent`
route supply it automatically from the VM's own record, so callers never handle it directly. This
stops a process on the host *other than ephemera* from opening a raw vsock socket to the VM's CID and
running commands as root — it does not replace REST-layer auth (see below), which answers a different
question ("can this caller reach ephemera's API at all"). A VM created before this existed, or with no
token file baked into its image for another reason, still runs the agent unauthenticated — check the
agent's own startup log line to be sure. Verified on real hardware
(`scripts/test-guest-agent-auth.sh`): a raw, tokenless (or wrong-token) vsock request is rejected,
the correct token succeeds, and `eph exec` keeps working unmodified.

`stop` always tries a graceful VMM-level shutdown first (QMP `system_powerdown` for QEMU, `ch-remote
shutdown` for Cloud Hypervisor, `SendCtrlAltDel` for Firecracker — x86_64 only, no ARM equivalent in
Firecracker's API today) and only force-kills the process if it doesn't exit within a grace period.

**Firecracker-specific note:** pause/resume were verified correct and fast against Firecracker's own
authoritative `GET /` state (not CPU-time heuristics — an idle guest and a paused one both show flat
CPU time, which is a false "it's paused" signal either way). `exec` over vsock works before a VM is
ever paused, but did not survive a pause/resume cycle in testing on this Firecracker version — a
Cloud Hypervisor VM's vsock connection *did* survive the identical pause/resume/exec sequence using
the same client code, so this looks like a Firecracker vsock characteristic rather than an ephemera
bug, but it's not something this project has a fix for.

**Interactive console:** `GET /v1/vms/{id}/console?cols=&rows=` upgrades to a WebSocket relayed
end-to-end to a real PTY-backed `/bin/sh` in the guest over the same vsock agent connection as
`exec` (see `ephemera_vsock_client::open_shell`) — real keystrokes, real job control, verified live
against a real QEMU VM (connect, `echo` a marker string, see it echoed back through the PTY).

**Fixed — process isolation, not a kernel-level root cause.** For a while, roughly 1-in-3 console
sessions left the guest agent's vsock listener unable to accept any further connections afterward
(`exec`/console/file-copy calls to the same VM would then fail with a raw `Connection reset by peer`),
with process/thread tracing showing the listener's `accept()` thread permanently parked in the
kernel's `vsock_accept`. Extensive live isolation ruled out every userspace trigger tried — whether
and from which thread `child.kill()`/`.wait()`/`.try_wait()` was called on the spawned shell made no
measurable difference, and a from-scratch reproducer mirroring the real PTY/fork/setsid/relay-thread
structure could not trigger it at all across 40+ trials while the real binary kept failing — pointing
at something below userspace, in the exact `AF_VSOCK`/`vhost_vsock` accept path, that was never
pinned down to a specific kernel commit or mechanism.

The actual fix doesn't require knowing that mechanism: `OpenShell` sessions are no longer handled in a
thread of the guest agent's own process at all. `spawn_open_shell_session()` double-forks — the
grandchild does the PTY/`setsid()`/shell/relay work fully detached from the agent's process tree (never
sharing a process, even via a thread, with the vsock listener), while the agent's original process
only reaps the fast-exiting intermediate child and returns straight to `accept()`. This is exactly how
OpenSSH's `sshd` and systemd isolate PTY/session-leader work from their own long-lived listeners — see
their `session.c`/`systemd-executor` fork-per-session model — for the same underlying reason: signal
disposition and `waitpid()` are process-wide, so a session leader's lifecycle can affect an unrelated
listener sharing its process in ways a separate process boundary cannot. Verified live: 20/20 console
sessions back-to-back left `exec` working afterward every time (statistically conclusive against the
prior ~1-in-3 failure rate), including through the real WebSocket console path end-to-end, not just a
raw vsock handshake. `zyvor-fabric`'s Ephemera driver can now safely request `agent.enabled: true` by
default — see its own `docs/guides/vm-drivers/ephemera.md`.

## Resource control (cgroup v2)

Every VM (all three backends) is migrated into its own `ephemera.slice/{id}.scope` cgroup right after
launch, giving real, kernel-enforced control independent of anything a VMM's own API exposes:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/vms/<uuid>/resources \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"cpu_quota_percent": 150, "memory_max_bytes": 536870912, "pids_max": 64}' | jq

curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/vms/<uuid>/freeze   # cgroup-level freeze — works even if the VMM's own API doesn't respond
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/vms/<uuid>/thaw
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/vms/<uuid>/frozen            # {"frozen": true|false}
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/vms/<uuid>/stats              # CPU%, memory, disk I/O, read from the cgroup
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/vms/<uuid>/pressure           # PSI: cpu/memory/io some+full, avg10/60/300 + total
```

`resources` (`ResourcePatch`) is a partial patch — only the fields you set are touched: `cpu_quota_percent`
(percentage of one core, e.g. `150` = 1.5 cores), `memory_max_bytes`, `io_weight` (1-10000), `pids_max`,
`cpuset_cpus` (pin to specific host cores). `freeze`/`thaw` act on the cgroup directly via
`cgroup.freeze`, independent of the VMM's own pause/resume API (see "Pause, resume, and exec" above) —
useful as a control path that still works if a VMM's control socket is unresponsive. Delegation
(`cgroup.subtree_control`) is set up once at `VmManager` startup; if that fails (e.g. no cgroup v2, or
insufficient privilege), resource control/metrics are unavailable for that run but VM creation/lifecycle
are otherwise unaffected — a warning is logged, not a hard failure.

Verified on real hardware (`scripts/test-cgroup-resources.sh`, all through the REST API against a
running `ephemera serve`): a launched VM really lands in its own cgroup (confirmed by reading
`cgroup.procs` directly, not just trusting the recorded path); a memory limit set via `resources` is
really written to `memory.max` and reads back correctly; `freeze` really stops the VMM process (CPU
time frozen with a forced busy-loop running in the guest, same technique used to verify QMP-level
pause) and `thaw` really resumes it; `stats`/`pressure` return real nonzero, cgroup-derived numbers;
`delete` removes the VM's cgroup directory.

## Warm VM pools

A pool keeps `size` VMs booted from a template sitting `Paused`, ready to be handed out on `claim` in
a fraction of a full `create`'s time instead of a full boot:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml pool create --spec examples/pool.json
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml pool list
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml pool get my-pool
```

Pool spec (`template` is a normal `CreateVmRequest` — its `name`/`ttl_seconds` are ignored for pool
members, which must never expire on their own while sitting idle):

```json
{
  "name": "my-pool",
  "size": 4,
  "template": {
    "name": "ignored",
    "backend": "qemu",
    "image": "/var/lib/ephemera/images/ubuntu-agent.qcow2",
    "vcpus": 2,
    "memory_mib": 2048,
    "network": {"mode": "none"},
    "agent": {"enabled": true, "port": 17777}
  }
}
```

Claim one through REST against a running `ephemera serve` daemon — the recommended way, since a
claim's own backfill-the-pool-back-up work runs as a background task inside that long-lived process:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/pools/my-pool/claim \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "job-123", "ttl_seconds": 900}' | jq
```

`ephemera pool claim <name>` also exists on the CLI, but as a **one-shot process** it exits right
after printing the claimed VM — which can take its own backfill-replenishment task down with it
mid-flight before the process exits. `ephemera pool create` avoids this by blocking until the pool is
genuinely full before its own process exits; `pool claim` deliberately doesn't, to keep a claim fast.
A separately-running `ephemera serve` daemon's reaper independently tops up every pool on its own
schedule regardless of which process's claim under-filled it, so pool health converges either way —
but for a claim's *own* immediate replenishment to be reliable, use REST against a running daemon.

Every pool member is verified genuinely ready — not just "a process exists" — before being paused: a
real bug found on real hardware pausing a member immediately after `create()` returns (before the
guest had even finished booting, let alone started its guest-agent) meant a "warm" member was actually
frozen mid-boot, so resuming it on claim still had to finish booting before `exec` worked at all,
defeating the point. Backfill now waits for the guest agent to answer a ping before pausing.

Verified on real hardware (`scripts/test-warm-pool.sh`): a pool backfills to size on its own, a REST
claim is dramatically faster than a plain create (real numbers observed: ~0.2–0.5s vs. ~4–17s), the
claimed VM works immediately (`exec` succeeds right away), the pool tops itself back up unasked after
each claim, two claims in a row hand out two different VMs, and `pool delete` cleans up every member
it still owns with no leftover VMs or processes.

## Build an image like a small virt-builder

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml build-image \
  --spec examples/build-image.json
```

The `source` can be a local path or an `http(s)` URL. You can add `sha256` to the request to pin the artifact.

Example request:

```json
{
  "source": "https://example.invalid/ubuntu-base.qcow2",
  "sha256": "PUT_REAL_SHA256_HERE",
  "output": "/var/lib/ephemera/images/ubuntu-dev.qcow2",
  "format": "qcow2",
  "size_gib": 20,
  "hostname": "zyvor-template",
  "packages": ["curl", "jq", "qemu-guest-agent"],
  "commands": ["systemctl enable qemu-guest-agent"]
}
```

`copy_in` places files directly into the image and `enable_services` runs `systemctl enable` for
each named unit — both, like every other customization field, done via `guestkit` mounting the
image directly with `qemu-nbd` (no libguestfs appliance). Neither needs outbound networking; the
`packages` field does — it runs the guest's own package manager (`apt`/`dnf`/`tdnf`/`yum`/`pacman`,
auto-detected) inside a chroot, temporarily staging the host's `/etc/resolv.conf` into the guest for
DNS resolution (a stock cloud image's own `/etc/resolv.conf` is normally a dangling symlink that
only resolves under a running systemd instance) and removing it again once installs finish.
This is how the guest agent gets baked into an image:

```json
{
  "source": "/var/lib/ephemera/images/ubuntu.qcow2",
  "output": "/var/lib/ephemera/images/ubuntu-agent.qcow2",
  "format": "qcow2",
  "copy_in": [
    {"src": "/path/to/target/release/ephemera-guest-agent", "dest": "/usr/local/bin/ephemera-guest-agent"},
    {"src": "systemd/ephemera-guest-agent.service", "dest": "/etc/systemd/system/ephemera-guest-agent.service"}
  ],
  "enable_services": ["ephemera-guest-agent"]
}
```

`packages` installs through whichever package manager `install_packages` actually finds inside the
guest (`apt-get`/`tdnf`/`dnf`/`yum`/`pacman`, checked in that order) — see
[`docs/build-image-tutorials.md`](docs/build-image-tutorials.md) for a full, real-hardware-verified
walkthrough per distro family (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL-family, Arch Linux), including the two things
Arch specifically needs (empty keyring, missing `/etc/mtab`) that `build-image` handles for you
automatically.

## Image catalog & signing

Reference a named, checksummed image instead of a raw path or URL — resolved transparently by
`create` before policy/existence checks, so `allowed_image_dirs` still governs the real resolved file:

```json
{"name": "job-1", "backend": "qemu", "image": "ubuntu-24.04", "...": "..."}
```

Enable it with `[catalog]` in the config:

```toml
[catalog]
path = "/etc/ephemera/catalog.json"
trusted_signers = []   # empty = signatures not required; non-empty = every entry MUST verify
```

An image reference that doesn't match any catalog entry's `name` is treated as a literal path/URL,
exactly like before this existed — the catalog is purely additive.

Signing is a self-contained Ed25519 scheme (not cosign/Sigstore, which need either a local `cosign`
binary or a live Fulcio/Rekor round trip — neither of which this project can verify end-to-end without
external network-dependent test infrastructure):

```bash
ephemera catalog keygen
#   private key (keep secret, use with `catalog sign --key`): ...
#   public key (put in config.catalog.trusted_signers): ...

ephemera catalog sign \
  --key <private-key> --name ubuntu-24.04 \
  --source https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/noble/release/ubuntu-24.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img \
  --sha256 <sha256> --distro ubuntu --version 24.04 --arch x86_64 \
  --catalog-file /etc/ephemera/catalog.json   # appends/updates in place; omit to just print the entry
```

With `trusted_signers` set, an unsigned (or wrongly-signed) catalog entry is rejected at `create` time
— fails closed, no silent fallback to "unsigned is fine." `GET /v1/images/catalog` lists every entry
with a computed `signature_valid` (read-only; signing stays a CLI/offline operation, so private keys
never touch the API surface).

**Catalog CRUD over REST** — add/remove/rename/clone/export entries without hand-editing
`catalog.json` or going through the CLI's offline sign flow (this is what zyvor-fabric's
`EphemeraDriver::ImageDriver` uses to replace machinectl's image-management verbs):

```bash
# Register a new entry — source can be a local path or an http(s) URL; sha256 is computed
# fresh from what actually lands on disk, not trusted from the caller.
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/images/catalog \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "ubuntu-24.04", "source": "/var/lib/ephemera/images/ubuntu.qcow2", "format": "qcow2"}' | jq

curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/images/catalog/ubuntu-24.04/clone \
  -d '{"target_name": "ubuntu-24.04-staging"}' | jq
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/images/catalog/ubuntu-24.04-staging/rename \
  -d '{"new_name": "ubuntu-24.04-qa"}' | jq
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/images/catalog/ubuntu-24.04/export \
  -d '{"path": "/var/lib/ephemera/exports/ubuntu-24.04.qcow2"}' | jq
curl -sS -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/images/catalog/ubuntu-24.04-qa
```

A clone or rename drops any existing signature (a signature covers the entry's `name`, so it no
longer vouches for the new one). All five mutating operations are serialized against each other and
against a fresh `catalog.json` read on every call — no in-memory cache to go stale.

Verified on real hardware (`scripts/test-image-catalog.sh`, 10/10): `keygen`/`sign` produce a real
verifiable entry; creating a VM by catalog name actually resolves and boots the underlying image; with
`trusted_signers` configured, an unsigned entry is rejected while a validly signed one is accepted (both
confirmed by actually trying to boot); a plain literal path still works unchanged; `GET
/v1/images/catalog` correctly reports `signature_valid: true`/`false` for the two cases. The CRUD
endpoints above were verified live against a real deployed instance: full add → list → clone →
rename → export (byte-identical file at the destination) → delete round trip, plus the duplicate-name
and not-found error paths.

## Storage backends

By default a VM's disk is provisioned the same way it always has been: a
qcow2 copy-on-write overlay for QEMU, a reflinked-or-copied raw file for
Cloud Hypervisor/Firecracker (see "What is implemented" above). Setting
`storage` on a create request switches to one of three alternative
provisioning backends instead — `ephemera_core::model::StorageBackend`,
implemented in `ephemera_image::storage`:

- **`lvm-thin`** — `image` must be a `/dev/<vg>/<lv>` path to an existing
  LVM thin logical volume (in a thin pool). A fresh thin *snapshot* LV is
  created per VM (`lvcreate --snapshot`) and handed to the VMM directly as a
  raw block device — real copy-on-write at the block layer, and near-instant
  regardless of image size. Verified end to end on real hardware: create →
  a genuinely new `/dev/<vg>/eph-<id>` snapshot LV appears → the guest boots
  off it and answers `exec` → `delete` removes the snapshot LV, `stop` alone
  leaves it in place (same as the disk file is left in place for every other
  backend). Not supported under the Firecracker jailer, since its
  chroot/hardlink resource-placement model doesn't extend to a shared block
  device — use direct (non-jailed) Firecracker, QEMU, or Cloud Hypervisor.
  **Real bug found and fixed while testing this**: LVM sets a persistent
  "activation skip" flag on every new thin snapshot by default; without
  `--setactivationskip n` on the `lvcreate`, the following `lvchange -ay`
  exits 0 but silently activates nothing, and the VM fails to boot with a
  "device does not exist" error. There's also a real (if narrow) udev race —
  `lvchange -ay` returns as soon as the kernel dm target is live, before
  udev has necessarily finished creating the `/dev/<vg>/<lv>` symlink — so
  provisioning polls for that symlink for up to 5s rather than trusting the
  command's exit status alone.
- **`nbd`** — QEMU only (QEMU has a native `nbd:` block client; Cloud
  Hypervisor and Firecracker don't). The disk is the same disposable qcow2
  overlay as the default backend, but it's exported over NBD via a
  `qemu-nbd` subprocess this VM owns (over a UNIX socket, not a TCP port)
  instead of being opened directly as a local file — the same client/server
  split real remote/shared NBD storage uses, without needing a separate
  storage host to prove the mechanism end to end. Verified on real hardware:
  the exporting `qemu-nbd` process is a real, findable pid; the guest boots
  over the NBD attachment and answers `exec`; `delete` kills the export
  (`stop` alone leaves it running, so a later `start` can reattach). **Real
  bug found and fixed while testing this**: injecting the guest-agent token
  into the disk (via `guestkit`, which does its own independent qemu-nbd
  mount) after this VM's own `qemu-nbd --persistent` export was already
  running raced its write lock and failed with "Failed to get 'write' lock".
  Fixed by injecting the token before the export starts, not after.
- **`ceph-rbd`** — `rbd clone <pool>/<image>@ephemera-base ...` and QEMU's
  native `rbd:` block driver (QEMU only; Cloud Hypervisor/Firecracker have
  no built-in Ceph client). Verified end to end against a real, live Rook
  Ceph cluster (the Atlas storage-control-plane project's lab: Rook v1.20.2
  + Ceph Squid v19.2.3, `rbd-nvme-prod` pool): imported a raw image as
  `rbd-nvme-prod/ephemera-base`, protected an `ephemera-base` snapshot on
  it, created a VM with `storage=ceph-rbd` — `rbd clone` produced a real
  `eph-<id>` clone, QEMU booted a real guest straight off
  `rbd:rbd-nvme-prod/eph-<id>:id=admin:conf=...` all the way to a login
  prompt, and `delete` reaped the clone (confirmed gone via `rbd ls`, no
  leak). Doesn't support automatic guest-agent token injection (`guestkit`
  needs a local file or block device to mount, not an arbitrary `rbd:`
  URI) — that combination fails fast with a clear error rather than
  attempting it.

`storage` defaults to unset (`Default`) on every create request — nothing
above changes any existing behavior unless a caller opts in.

See `scripts/test-storage-backends.sh` for the repeatable real-hardware
regression test covering `lvm-thin` and `nbd` (it also sets up a
loopback-backed thin pool from scratch if you don't already have one — see
the script's own `--help`). `ceph-rbd` isn't in that script — it was
verified manually against the specific external Rook Ceph lab above, which
this repo has no automated way to stand up or tear down; the recipe was:
`rbd import` a raw image into a pool, `rbd snap create` + `rbd snap
protect` an `ephemera-base` snapshot on it, then create a VM with
`"storage":"ceph-rbd","image":"<pool>/<image>"`.

## REST API

Start the server:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/ephemera --config /etc/ephemera.toml serve
```

Default bind address:

```text
127.0.0.1:7788
```

Endpoints:

```text
GET    /healthz
GET    /metrics
POST   /v1/vms
GET    /v1/vms
GET    /v1/vms/{uuid}
POST   /v1/vms/{uuid}/start
POST   /v1/vms/{uuid}/stop
POST   /v1/vms/{uuid}/pause
POST   /v1/vms/{uuid}/resume
POST   /v1/vms/{uuid}/resources
POST   /v1/vms/{uuid}/freeze
POST   /v1/vms/{uuid}/thaw
GET    /v1/vms/{uuid}/frozen
GET    /v1/vms/{uuid}/stats
GET    /v1/vms/{uuid}/pressure
GET    /v1/vms/{uuid}/logs
POST   /v1/vms/{uuid}/agent
DELETE /v1/vms/{uuid}
POST   /v1/images/build
GET    /v1/images/catalog
POST   /v1/images/catalog
DELETE /v1/images/catalog/{name}
POST   /v1/images/catalog/{name}/rename
POST   /v1/images/catalog/{name}/clone
POST   /v1/images/catalog/{name}/export
POST   /v1/pools
GET    /v1/pools
GET    /v1/pools/{name}
DELETE /v1/pools/{name}
POST   /v1/pools/{name}/claim
```

`GET /v1/vms?name=<name>` exact-matches on `VmRecord.name` server-side. `POST /v1/vms/{uuid}/start`
relaunches a `Stopped` VM from its existing disk/seed, skipping the image-clone/cloud-init/token-inject
work `create` does — for a name-keyed register-then-start caller that already has a VM on disk it just
needs running again.

`GET /metrics` returns Prometheus text-exposition-format gauges: `ephemera_vms_total{status="..."}`,
`ephemera_vms_by_backend{backend="..."}`, and `ephemera_vms_agent_enabled` — point a Prometheus
`scrape_config` at it directly, no exporter needed.

`GET /v1/vms/{uuid}/logs?lines=N&follow=true` streams the VM's captured console output (raw serial,
no per-line structure) as chunked plain text — `lines` (default 100) controls how much history to
send before either ending (default) or switching to a live tail (`follow=true`, polling the log file
every 300ms for new lines). Verified against a real booting VM: both the initial tail and the live
follow stream return real, growing boot output.

### Auth / RBAC

`[[auth.tokens]]` entries in the config (see `config.example.toml`) enable bearer-token auth on every
route except `GET /healthz`. Absent or empty `auth.tokens` (the default) leaves the API exactly as
open as the pre-auth MVP — every request is treated as `admin`. Two roles:

- `admin` — everything: create/stop/pause/resume/exec/delete/build-image/resources/freeze/thaw.
- `read-only` — any `GET` route (`/v1/vms`, `/v1/vms/{uuid}`, `/metrics`, `/frozen`, `/stats`,
  `/pressure`, pool list/get) only; any mutating route (including `resources`/`freeze`/`thaw`) returns 403.

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/vms -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

No token, or a token not in the config, gets 401. A `read-only` token on a mutating route gets 403.
Token comparison is constant-time. Verified on real hardware: 401 with no/wrong token, 200 for
`read-only` on `GET /v1/vms`, 403 for `read-only` on `POST /v1/vms`, 400 for `admin` on the same route
with an invalid body (proving auth let it through to the actual handler), 200 on `/healthz` with no
token at all even with auth enabled.

Create through REST:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/vms \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @examples/qemu.json | jq
```

Exec through REST (`agent.enabled: true` required, see below):

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/vms/<uuid>/agent \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"command": "echo hello", "timeout_seconds": 30}' | jq
```

## VM JSON contract

`backend` is one of `"qemu"`, `"cloud-hypervisor"`, `"firecracker"`, or `"auto"` (see "Auto backend
selection" above — the persisted/returned record always shows the resolved concrete backend, never
`"auto"`).

```json
{
  "name": "job-123",
  "backend": "qemu",
  "image": "/var/lib/ephemera/images/ubuntu.qcow2",
  "vcpus": 2,
  "memory_mib": 2048,
  "disk_size_gib": 20,
  "network": {
    "mode": "user",
    "forwards": [
      {"host_port": 2222, "guest_port": 22, "protocol": "tcp"}
    ]
  },
  "cloud_init": {
    "hostname": "job-123",
    "user": "zyvor",
    "ssh_authorized_keys": ["ssh-ed25519 AAAA..."],
    "packages": ["curl"],
    "runcmd": ["echo hello > /tmp/hello"]
  },
  "agent": {"enabled": true, "port": 17777},
  "ttl_seconds": 600,
  "extra_args": [],
  "storage": "default"
}
```

`agent.enabled` turns on the vsock guest agent (`ephemera exec`) for this VM — the guest image must
have `ephemera-guest-agent` installed and enabled (see "Build an image" above). `agent.port` is the
AF_VSOCK port the guest listens on (not a host TCP port); it defaults to `17777` and rarely needs
changing, since each VM already gets its own host-unique vsock CID.

`storage` is one of `"default"` (the implicit default when the field is omitted entirely — qcow2/raw,
exactly as before this existed), `"lvm-thin"`, `"nbd"`, or `"ceph-rbd"` — see "Storage backends" above.

### Networking modes

`none`:

```json
{"mode":"none"}
```

QEMU user networking:

```json
{
  "mode":"user",
  "forwards":[{"host_port":2222,"guest_port":22,"protocol":"tcp"}]
}
```

TAP/bridge (all VMMs):

```json
{
  "mode":"tap",
  "bridge":"vmbr0",
  "mac":"06:00:AC:10:00:02"
}
```

When `tap_name` is omitted, the manager creates one from the VM UUID.

macvtap (QEMU and Cloud Hypervisor only — see below):

```json
{
  "mode": "macvtap",
  "parent": "eth0",
  "macvtap_mode": "bridge",
  "mac": "52:54:00:aa:bb:cc"
}
```

Gives the VM its own MAC directly on `parent`'s link — no host bridge involved. `macvtap_mode` is
the macvtap link mode: `bridge` (default — siblings on the same parent can reach each other, but
not the parent itself directly), `vepa`, `private`, or `passthru`. The manager creates a per-VM
macvtap device on `parent`, opens its `/dev/tapN` character device, and passes that file descriptor
directly to the VMM (`-netdev tap,fd=N` for QEMU, `--net fd=N` for Cloud Hypervisor) — there's no
persistent named tap the VMM opens itself, which is why **Firecracker doesn't support this mode**:
its API only accepts a host device name it opens via `/dev/net/tun`, with no fd-passing option.

## Kubernetes CRD/operator

`ephemera-kube` is a `DisposableVm` custom resource plus a node-local operator that reconciles them
against a *local* `ephemera serve` instance's REST API — there's no central scheduler placing VMs
across a fleet (that's the still-deferred "distributed node-agent" item below); each node's operator
instance only ever acts on `DisposableVm` objects whose `spec.node` matches the node name it was
started with (`NODE_NAME` env var), same shape as a real daemonset — see [`deploy/k8s/`](deploy/k8s/)
for the Dockerfile + CRD/RBAC/DaemonSet manifests that package it as exactly that.

Verified end to end against a real k3s cluster (`scripts/test-kube-operator.sh`, 9/9 passing):
generate the CRD straight from the Rust type and apply it, create a `DisposableVm`, watch it
reconcile into a real, running QEMU VM (confirmed via the local REST API, not just "the CR looks
fine"), delete the CR and confirm `kubectl delete` blocks on a finalizer until the real VM is
actually gone — no leaked QEMU process.

```bash
# Generate + install the CRD once.
ephemera-kube --print-crd | kubectl apply -f -

# Run the operator on this node (typically one instance per node, alongside
# a local `ephemera serve`).
NODE_NAME=$(hostname) EPHEMERA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7788 ephemera-kube
```

```yaml
apiVersion: ephemera.zyvor.io/v1
kind: DisposableVm
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  node: worker-1          # must match some running operator's NODE_NAME
  backend: qemu
  image: /var/lib/ephemera/images/ubuntu.qcow2
  vcpus: 2
  memoryMib: 2048
  networkMode: none        # "none" or "user" only — tap/macvtap need a device/bridge name this CRD doesn't expose yet
  storage: default          # default | lvm-thin | nbd | ceph-rbd — see "Storage backends" above
  ttlSeconds: 600
```

**Declarative, not one-shot** — a real, tested property, not just a design intention: if the
underlying VM disappears on its own (its `ttlSeconds` expired, or something deleted it via the REST
API directly) the operator notices on its next reconcile and creates a *new* VM to replace it — a
different id, a different pid — the same "keep this existing" semantics a `Deployment` has for Pods.
Confirmed by deleting a CR-owned VM out-of-band and watching a fresh one appear within two reconcile
ticks, with no action taken on the CR itself. Only deleting the `DisposableVm` object itself stops
this (see `DisposableVmStatus::phase`'s doc comment in `crates/ephemera-kube/src/crd.rs`).

**Real bug found and fixed while testing this**: `ephemera-api`'s `ApiError` maps *every* error to a
generic `400 Bad Request` — there's no distinct `404` anywhere in this API. The operator's initial
"is this VM still there" check assumed 404-on-missing (the REST-idiomatic assumption) and never
actually fired; a VM that vanished was reported as a transient error and endlessly retried instead of
triggering recreation. Fixed by checking the response body's error message instead of the status code.

**Not yet done**: packaging the operator as an actual container image + daemonset manifest (it was
run as a plain host process against a real cluster for this round's verification, not deployed
in-cluster); a `tap`/`macvtap` networking mode in the CRD (needs a device/bridge name field); and any
cross-node placement — the "which node should this VM land on" decision is the caller's today, made
by setting `spec.node` directly, not something this project chooses for you.

## Using Ephemera through zyvor-fabric

[zyvor-fabric](../zyvor-fabric) is the other primary consumer of Ephemera, and the older/more
direct of the two integrations: unlike Ragnarok's Kubernetes CRD approach (see below), zyvor-fabric
talks straight to a host's `ephemera serve` REST API (`backend/crates/ephemera-driver` +
`ephemera-client` hand-mirror Ephemera's own DTOs rather than depending on this crate directly —
see zyvor-fabric's `docs/guides/vm-drivers/ephemera.md`), the same API documented above under "REST
API". Set `driver = "ephemera"` in zyvor-fabricd's config to opt into it (the default is still
`machinectl`/systemd-machined — CPU pinning, log streaming, and hotplug require `machinectl` until
Ephemera gains resource-control and log-streaming endpoints of its own; see the systemd-removal
migration plan).

**Getting zyvor-fabric**: zyvor-fabric's own repo is private, so its build is published here
instead, as a self-contained Linux (x86_64) tarball — no cargo/npm required on the target
machine — attached to this repo's
[`zyvor-fabric-vX.Y.Z`-tagged releases](https://github.com/zyvorai/ephemera/releases). No
container image is published; install directly on the host:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/zyvorai/ephemera/releases/download/zyvor-fabric-v0.1.0/zyvor-fabric-0.1.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzf zyvor-fabric-0.1.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd zyvor-fabric-0.1.0-linux-x86_64
sudo ./install.sh --start
```

The [release](https://github.com/zyvorai/ephemera/releases/tag/zyvor-fabric-v0.1.0) also carries
an `INSTALL.md` with a full getting-started tutorial (first login, creating your first VM,
networking, verifying the install, upgrading). The tarball itself bundles
`zyvor-fabricd`/`zyvorctl`, a matching Ephemera build, guestkit's vendor agents, the web dashboard,
systemd units for both `zyvor-fabricd.service` and `ephemera.service`, and default configs --
`install.sh` wires all of it up (see zyvor-fabric's own `scripts/build-dist.sh` for exactly what
goes into the package and `scripts/dist-install.sh` for what the installer does). This release
build carries a 30-day evaluation trial (existing VMs and read access stay available after it
lapses; new writes need a current trial or license -- check remaining days via `GET /api/license`
on the running daemon).

## Using Ephemera through Ragnarok

[Ragnarok](../ragnarok) is the primary product consumer of `ephemera-kube` today — it never talks
to a host's `ephemera serve` REST API directly; it only creates/reads/deletes `DisposableVm` CRs
and lets the per-node operator (see "Kubernetes CRD/operator" above) do the rest. From Ephemera's
side, Ragnarok is just another `DisposableVm` client with no special access — the same CRD/RBAC
setup in `deploy/k8s/` works for it or for `kubectl apply` directly.

**Ephemera is free (Apache-2.0). Ragnarok is proprietary** (signed `trial.token`
evaluation, then a renewed JWT from sales@zyvor.dev).

### Download Ragnarok binaries (published here)

Ragnarok's source repo is private, so **binary-only** trial packages are attached to this
Ephemera repository's GitHub Releases (same pattern as zyvor-fabric), tagged `ragnarok-vX.Y.Z`:

```bash
VER=0.5.2
curl -LO "https://github.com/zyvorai/ephemera/releases/download/ragnarok-v${VER}/ragnarok-${VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
curl -LO "https://github.com/zyvorai/ephemera/releases/download/ragnarok-v${VER}/ragnarok-${VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256"
sha256sum -c "ragnarok-${VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256"
tar xzf "ragnarok-${VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
cd "ragnarok-${VER}-linux-amd64"
ls -l trial.token                 # keep beside ./ragnarok (or set RAGNAROK_TRIAL_TOKEN)
./install.sh
# Edit ragnarok.env (kubeconfig, JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL), then:
set -a && source ragnarok.env && set +a && ./ragnarok
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5010/health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5010/api/v1/license/status
```

Requires Linux x86_64, Kubernetes, and **KubeVirt**. After the token expires email
**sales@zyvor.dev** for a renewed signed JWT (see `LICENSING.md` / `AFTER-TRIAL.md`
in the tarball).

**Customer / install guide:** [docs/ragnarok.md](docs/ragnarok.md) — install order, manuals, SSO note.
Published manuals: [Ephemera](https://zyvor.dev/docs/ephemera-manual) · [Ragnarok](https://zyvor.dev/docs/ragnarok-manual) · [suite](https://zyvor.dev/docs/customer-manuals).

**Setup**, from Ephemera's side, is exactly "Deploy order" above — install the CRD/RBAC/DaemonSet,
label each capable node `ragnarok.io/ephemera-capable=true`, stage images. Ragnarok has no separate
install step for Ephemera itself; it only detects what's already there (see below).

**SSO / identity** is entirely Ragnarok's job (local admin, LDAP, Keycloak OIDC with optional
in-cluster IdP proxy via Ragnarok `--with-oidc`). Ephemera does not terminate browser SSO.
**Ephemera is free (Apache-2.0); Ragnarok is proprietary** (signed `trial.token`,
then a renewed JWT from sales@zyvor.dev). Do not put Ragnarok trial signing tools
or private keys in this repository.

**What Ragnarok adds on top** (`ragnarok/backend/src/ephemera/`, REST surface in
`routes/ephemera.rs`, UI in the frontend's `EphemeraHub` page):

- `GET /api/v1/ephemera/capability` — whether the `DisposableVm` CRD is actually registered on the
  connected cluster (a single `list` call, distinguishing "operator not installed" from "installed,
  zero VMs" — see `ephemera::workload::disposable_vm_crd_available`'s doc comment for why that's not
  as simple as checking for an empty list). Ragnarok's Ephemera Hub page shows an "operator not
  detected" banner instead of a broken-looking empty page when this is false — see the root
  Ragnarok README's "What works in this beta" table.
- `GET /api/v1/ephemera/nodes` — nodes labeled `ragnarok.io/ephemera-capable=true`, for a node
  picker in the UI. Ephemera has no scheduler (see "Kubernetes CRD/operator" above); Ragnarok's
  create form is the thing choosing `spec.node`, the same way any other caller has to.
- `GET/POST /api/v1/ephemera/vms`, `GET/DELETE /api/v1/ephemera/vms/{namespace}/{name}` — thin
  CRUD wrappers around the CR, namespace-scoped to the calling user's RBAC (`enforce_namespace_access`).
  Ragnarok sets no fields on the CR beyond what a caller could set by hand — no Ragnarok-specific
  CRD fields or annotations exist today.

**Not done on the Ragnarok side**: `tap`/`macvtap` networking (blocked on the CRD itself not
supporting it yet — see "Known limitations" in `deploy/k8s/README.md`), and any cross-node
placement beyond letting the user pick a node from the capable-nodes list.

## Distributed node-agent

`ephemera-agent` is the non-Kubernetes multi-host story — a caller talks to one central endpoint
instead of knowing which host a VM is on, distinct from `ephemera-kube`'s per-node reconciliation
against a *local* ephemera. One binary, two modes:

```bash
# Central fleet registry + create/list/delete proxy — one instance for the whole fleet.
ephemera-agent central --listen 0.0.0.0:7799

# Per-host heartbeat client — one instance per hypervisor host, alongside a local `ephemera serve`.
ephemera-agent node --name worker-1 \
    --central http://fleet-registry:7799 \
    --ephemera-url http://127.0.0.1:7788 \
    --advertise-url http://worker-1.internal:7788
```

Every `--interval-secs` (default 10), each node agent reports its name, real capacity (vCPUs off
`available_parallelism()`, RAM off `/proc/meminfo`), and current VM count (via its own local
`GET /v1/vms`) to the central registry. `POST /fleet/vms` with no `"node"` field picks the healthy
node with the fewest VMs and proxies the create there; with an explicit `"node"` it targets that node
directly. `GET /fleet/vms` aggregates every healthy node's VMs, tagged with which node each came from.
`DELETE /fleet/vms/{node}/{id}` proxies to that exact node.

Verified end to end across two real, physically separate hosts (`scripts/test-fleet-agent.sh`, 11/11
passing): both hosts register with real capacity; an unaddressed create picks the least-loaded host
and produces a real QEMU process confirmed on that exact physical host (and confirmed absent on the
other); a second create lands on the *other* host once the first host's load is known — real
load-aware placement, not round-robin; the fleet-wide list correctly aggregates and tags VMs from
both hosts; a fleet-proxied delete reaps the right VM on the right host and leaves the other alone.

**Real bugs found and fixed while testing this across two actual hosts** (bugs that are invisible
running everything on one machine, which is exactly why this got tested on two real, separate hosts
instead of just trusting the code): a node's heartbeat originally reported its own `--ephemera-url`
(almost always a loopback address) straight to central — central's proxy calls for a *remote* node
would then silently hit whatever was listening on *central's own* localhost instead, with no error at
all. Fixed by splitting `--ephemera-url` (what this agent uses to reach its own local ephemera) from
`--advertise-url` (what a remote central should use to reach this same ephemera — must be a real,
externally routable address). Separately, this test script's own cleanup function first tried
`sudo pkill -f "target/release/ephemera --config ..."` over SSH — which matched **its own** command
line (the pattern string is a substring of the `pkill` invocation's own argv) and SIGTERMed itself
before it ever reached the real target process, leaving the actual `ephemera serve` running every
time with no error surfaced. Fixed with the standard `[t]arget/...` bracket-escape idiom that keeps
`pgrep`/`pkill -f` from matching their own invocation.

**Not yet done**: TLS/auth between node agents and central (both sides currently trust any caller who
can reach the port — fine for a private management network, not for anything exposed further);
persisting fleet registry state (an `ephemera-agent central` restart forgets every node until their
next heartbeat, ~`--interval-secs` seconds later); and richer placement policies beyond
fewest-VMs-wins (no CPU/memory-aware bin-packing, no per-VM node affinity/anti-affinity).

## State layout

```text
/var/lib/ephemera/
  vms.json
  vms.lock
  downloads/
  images/
  kernels/
  instances/
    <uuid>/
      root.qcow2 | root.raw
      seed.img
      user-data
      meta-data
      console.log
      qmp.sock | ch-api.sock | firecracker.sock
      vsock.sock              (Cloud Hypervisor/Firecracker only, when agent.enabled)
      firecracker.json
      nbd.sock | nbd.pid      (storage=nbd only — see "Storage backends")
```

`storage=lvm-thin` and `storage=ceph-rbd` disks live outside this tree entirely — a thin
snapshot LV (`/dev/<vg>/eph-<id>`) and an RBD clone (`rbd:<pool>/eph-<id>:...`) respectively,
both torn down by `delete` via `VmRecord.lvm_lv`/parsing the `rbd:` URI, not by deleting
anything under `instances/<uuid>/`.

`vms.lock` coordinates `vms.json` reads/writes across concurrent `ephemera` processes (each CLI
invocation is a separate process, not just a separate task inside `serve`) via an OS-level `flock` —
without it, two VMs created at the same moment could silently lose one's record, or both get
assigned the same vsock CID.

## Production changes I would make next

1. **Firecracker jailer's own `--cgroup`/`--resource-limit` flags** — not wired up, but superseded in practice: every VM (all three backends, not just jailed Firecracker) already gets real cgroup v2 resource control (CPU/memory/IO/pids/cpuset, freeze/thaw, stats, PSI pressure) independent of the jailer — see "Resource control (cgroup v2)" above.
2. **Network namespace policy** — one namespace per VM (veth + NAT + internal bridge) is already implemented and opt-in per VM (see "Network namespaces" above); still missing: nftables instead of one flat iptables MASQUERADE rule per VM, and real IPAM (subnets are derived deterministically from the VM id rather than tracked/reused, a documented theoretical-collision tradeoff).
3. **Snapshots** — full VM state + disk snapshots per backend, for restoring a specific VM's exact prior state (as opposed to warm pools, already implemented, which speed up starting a *fresh* VM from a template — see "Warm VM pools" above).
4. **Storage abstraction** — already implemented and fully verified: qcow2 CoW overlay and raw reflink (the always-on defaults, per VMM backend), plus opt-in LVM thin snapshots, NBD-exported disks, and Ceph RBD — all verified booting real guests on real hardware, Ceph RBD against a real Rook Ceph cluster; see "Storage backends" below. Not done: NVMe-local as a distinct backend (a local raw file/block device already gets NVMe's real performance with no extra abstraction needed — reflink/LVM already cover that case).
5. **Image catalog** — already implemented: named/checksummed/Ed25519-signed entries, distro/version/arch metadata (see "Image catalog & signing" above). Not done: a cosign/Sigstore option specifically, for shops standardized on that instead of this project's own signing scheme.
6. **Policy** — allowed networking modes are still unrestricted (max vCPU/RAM/disk/TTL and allowed backends/image directories are already implemented; see "Policy (admission limits)" above).
7. **Auth** — mTLS/OIDC, tenant IDs and audit events. Bearer-token REST auth/RBAC (admin/read-only) and a per-VM authenticated guest-agent protocol are already implemented; see "Auth / RBAC" and "Pause, resume, and exec" above.
8. **Observability** — tracing, per-VM boot timing and failure reasons (a basic Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint — VM counts by status/backend, agent-enabled count — is already implemented; see the REST API section).
9. **Kubernetes CRD/operator** — already implemented and verified against a real k3s cluster: `DisposableVm` CRD + node-local operator (`ephemera-kube`); see "Kubernetes CRD/operator" above. Not done: packaging it as a real container image/daemonset manifest, a tap/macvtap networking mode in the CRD, and cross-node placement.
10. **Distributed node-agent** — already implemented and verified across two real, physically separate hosts: `ephemera-agent` (the per-*host* one, not `ephemera-guest-agent`) central registry + node heartbeat client; see "Distributed node-agent" above. Not done: TLS/auth between nodes and central, persisted fleet state, and placement policies beyond fewest-VMs-wins.
11. **Scheduler placement** — NUMA awareness, CPU pinning, hugepages and GPU/VFIO assignment.
12. **Windows path** — QEMU/Cloud Hypervisor only; UEFI, virtio-win injection, sysprep and unattend support.

"auto" backend selection is already implemented — see "Auto backend selection" above.

## Important limitations in this MVP

- QEMU user networking is supported; Cloud Hypervisor and Firecracker require TAP, macvtap (Cloud Hypervisor only), or no networking.
- TAP and macvtap setup require host network privilege (CAP_NET_ADMIN).
- The bridge (for TAP) or parent link (for macvtap) must already exist and be configured for the network behavior you want.
- macvtap's `bridge` mode is asymmetric by design: sibling macvtap devices on the same parent can reach each other, but not the parent/host interface itself directly. Firecracker has no fd-passing option in its API, so macvtap isn't supported there.
- Firecracker image preparation is stricter than QEMU because it boots a kernel/rootfs directly.
- Guest disk partition/filesystem expansion after `qemu-img resize` is an image/guest concern. Use cloud-init growpart or your image pipeline.
- `extra_args` is intentionally an administrator escape hatch. Do not expose it to untrusted tenants.
- The API is localhost-only by default. Bearer-token auth/RBAC is opt-in (see "Auth / RBAC") — an operator who doesn't configure `[[auth.tokens]]` still gets the old open-by-default behavior.
- The vsock guest agent is authenticated by default for any VM created with `agent.enabled: true` (see "Pause, resume, and exec"), but this doesn't extend to mTLS/OIDC-style identity — it's one shared secret per VM, good enough to stop an unrelated host process, not a multi-tenant authorization model.
- `guestkit`'s `inspect_os()` (used by `copy_in`) only recognizes partitioned disks and LVM volumes as OS roots by default; support for a bare, unpartitioned whole-disk filesystem (the shape Firecracker rootfs images are typically built in) was added as part of this project's testing and needs to make it into a real guestkit release — until then, building against a `guestkit` checkout without that fix will fail `copy_in` on such images with "no operating system found in image".
